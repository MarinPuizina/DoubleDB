# DoubleDB

This is my practice project where I want to use two databases, MySQL and maybe Cassandra or some other nosql db.
It will be console based project and I want to practice some design patterns while writing code.
I will also use encription for user passwords, which will be stored into MySQL db. So I will be making
user registration and login logic with validation.

Later in project I want to store some data in NoSQL db and test its capabilities. I want to be able to decide
from which db I want to pull data. 

So far this is my idea for this project which I'm sure will change in future.
